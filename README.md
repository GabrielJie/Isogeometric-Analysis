# Isogeometric Analysis
Hi and welcome to the GitHub page for my Isogeometric Analysis library.

The code that I provide complement my research in phase field modeling.
I hope that you find the library useful in learning isogeometric analysis
and solving your own finite element method problems.

Unless I noted otherwise, I have written all code. I'd much appreciate it
if you cite my blog (crunchingnumbers.live) and code in your medium of
output, e.g. papers, code, your very own blog. :)

If you find a bug in my code or have suggestions for making my code better
and simpler, please let me know.


Isaac,
